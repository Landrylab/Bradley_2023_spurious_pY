# Bradley_2023_spurious_pY

Scripts for the paper on spurious tyrosine phosphorylation in yeast (Bradley et al., 2023). The repository is divided into the following
four directories:

* Structure: Figure 2 and associated analyses
* Fitnesss: Figure 3 and associated analyses
* Evolution_yeast_human: Figure 4 and associated analyses (the extent to which native pY in human overlaps with spurious pY in yeast)
* Counter_selection: Figure 5 and associated analyses (whether spurious pY sites are counter-selected in species that have tyrosine kinases)

Scripts for the Figure 1 analysis (MS/MS data analysis) are publicly available under: https://gitlab.com/public_villenlab/spurious-phosphorylation
